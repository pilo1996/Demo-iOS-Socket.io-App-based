# Demo iOS Socket.io App based
It's just a dumb demo to be used with Node.js server with Socket.io 

## Configuring the Server Side
- Run Server.js in my other repo
- In ```ContentView.swift``` change your ip address and port. It can be used localhost by putting ```ws://localhost:3000```
- Run the App

## Horrible stuffs
Probably everything sucks but most important thing is to use the iOS App with Dark Mode for the white Navigation Bar Title.
Using the Light Mode the foreground color's Navigation Bar Title will be in black and idk how to change it.

## Importing Socket.io Client in Swift
TODO
